Installing CivCraft can be a bit of a challenge so here are the basic steps in order.

Prereqs:
=========
1) You have a working MySQL server and you know how to use it.
2) You have Eclipse installed and can figure out how to compile CivCraft.jar from source.
3) You understand how to install Bukkit plugins to a minecraft server.


Install Instructions:
======================
1) Compile CivCraft.jar from source.
    a) You must compile CivCraft.jar with the provided manifest file.
Otherwise you'll get errors saying "BoneCP' class cannot be found.
    b) You will need to grab all of the library dependancies. I've included my
classpath so you'll be able to see the jar names.

2) Put CivCraft.jar in your plugins directory.
   a) CivCraft requires TagAPI and Herochat. Install those plugins alongside it as well.
   b) WorldBorder is also required.

3) Run the server once, CivCraft will fail to load but thats OK. Stop server and continue.

4) In the "<mc_server>/plugins/CivCraft" directory modify config.yml to point to two SQL databases.
   a) You first need a 'game' database to store local server information.
   b) Next you need a 'global' database to store global server information.

   The databases should be empty and upon start up, civcraft will populate and create the desired tables.

5) Copy plugins to <mc_server> directory, merging with your existing plugins folder.

6) Copy civcraft_data/templates to the <mc_server> directory.

7) Modify your java launch options to give civcraft at least 2GB of memory.

8) Launch server, hopefully it will start without any errors.


Installing CivCraft dynmap:
============================
1) Compile civcraft_dymap from source.

2) Install dynmap plugin.

3) Drop civcraft_dymap.jar into plugins directroy.
